# Phase 4: Shared Component Library

**Goal**: Build the reusable "dumb" components that will be used across features.

## Tasks
1. **Atomic UI Components (`src/components/ui`)**:
   - Build `Button.jsx` (with variants: primary, secondary, ghost).
   - Build `Input.jsx` and `Label.jsx`.
   - Build `Card.jsx` (container with premium styling).
   - Build `Modal.jsx` and `Badge.jsx`.

2. **Styling Utilities**:
   - Implement reusable classes for Glassmorphism effects.
