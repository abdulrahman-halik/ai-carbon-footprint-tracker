## Phase 6: User Onboarding Wizard Structure
**Goal:** Create the multi-step container for the initial user assessment.

- [ ] **Feature Structure (`features/onboarding`)**:
    - `WizardLayout.jsx` (Progress bar, step navigation).
    - `OnboardingProvider.jsx` (Context for wizard state).
- [ ] **Navigation Logic**:
    - Implement "Next" and "Back" step transitions.
    - Handle state preservation between steps.
